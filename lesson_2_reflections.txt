What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Nothing gets put in the repository.  You must add files to it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It allows an intermediate step before committing.  Could be valuable if you want to commit files together vs separately.
